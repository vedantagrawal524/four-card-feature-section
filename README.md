## Overview

A sleek, modern section layout that highlights four key features with a card-based UI. The project helped me sharpen my skills in **CSS Grid**, **responsive layouts**, and semantic **HTML5**. Each card is uniquely styled with a colored top border and icon, giving it a visually distinct identity.
